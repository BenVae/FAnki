- [x] Modify Deck model to support parent-child relationships
- [x] Update Firestore schema for nested deck structure
- [x] Create expandable tree view UI component
- [x] Implement deck path navigation (breadcrumbs)
- [x] Update deck selection to handle subdeck logic
- [ ] Add deck moving/reorganization functionality
