## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Enable AI Functionality (30 minutes)
**Goal:** Get AI card generation working with real OpenAI API

### Step 1: Environment Setup (5 minutes)
- [x] Get OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- [x] Create `.env` file with `OPEN_AI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
- [x] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to keep key secure
- [x] Create `env.dart` with validation function using `--dart-define-from-file`
- [x] Update `main.dart` to validate environment variables

### Step 2: Fix AI Service (10 minutes)
- [x] AI Service already properly implemented with real OpenAI API calls
- [x] JSON parsing with `json.decode()` already in place
- [x] Uses OpenAI API key from environment via `Env.openaiApiKey`
- [x] Parses actual response structure from GPT

### Step 3: Connect AI to UI (10 minutes)
- [x] AI Import Cubit already properly connected to real AI service
- [x] Uses `await _aiService!.generateCardsFromPdf(selectedPdf!)` for real AI calls
- [x] Gets real suggested deck name from AI via `suggestDeckName()`
- [x] Proper API error handling with try/catch blocks
- [x] Updated to use new `Env.openaiApiKey` approach

### Step 4: Error Handling & Polish (5 minutes)
- [x] Proper error messages already implemented in UI
- [x] Processing progress with animated messages and loading indicators
- [x] Fixed null error in card addition to decks
- [ ] Add cost estimation display
- [ ] Test with various PDF formats

### âœ… BREAKTHROUGH: AI Integration Complete!
- [x] Environment setup with `--dart-define-from-file` approach
- [x] Real OpenAI API integration working
- [x] AI card generation from PDFs functional
- [x] AI-suggested deck names working
- [x] Fixed critical null error in card saving
- [x] Ready for full demo testing!
