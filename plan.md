## Current Status: 
**Completed:** 
- Core UI and infrastructure for AI card generation
- Enhanced flashcard learning interface with 3D flip animations
- Modern deck management UI with card-based layout
- Progress tracking and statistics display
**Next Priority:** Card creation interface and Firebase integration

## Recent Accomplishments:

### Phase 1 - Flashcard UI:
- ✅ Implemented 3D card flip animation with smooth transitions
- ✅ Added gradient backgrounds (blue for questions, green for answers)
- ✅ Created color-coded difficulty buttons (Red: Again, Orange: Hard, Blue: Good, Green: Easy)
- ✅ Added progress tracking bar showing cards reviewed/total
- ✅ Improved card design with shadows and rounded corners
- ✅ Added visual icons for questions and answers
- ✅ Fixed deprecated API usage (withOpacity → withValues)

### Phase 2 - Deck Management UI:
- ✅ Redesigned with card-based grid layout (responsive design)
- ✅ Added card count statistics for each deck
- ✅ Implemented animated deck selection with scale effects
- ✅ Created empty state with helpful illustration
- ✅ Added floating action button for deck creation
- ✅ Improved dialogs with modern styling and icons
- ✅ Added visual "Active" badge for selected deck
- ✅ Implemented smooth transitions and animations

## Immediate Next Steps:

### 1. Enable Real AI Processing
- [ ] Add OpenAI API key to environment configuration
- [ ] Implement proper JSON parsing in `ai_service.dart`
- [ ] Test with actual PDF files
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully

### 2. Improve PDF Processing
- [ ] Add support for various PDF formats
- [ ] Implement better text extraction for complex layouts
- [ ] Add progress tracking during extraction
- [ ] Handle large PDFs (>100 pages) efficiently

### 3. Enhance Card Generation
- [ ] Implement proper prompt engineering for better card quality
- [ ] Add different card types (multiple choice, true/false, etc.)
- [ ] Implement subject-specific prompts
- [ ] Add card difficulty estimation

### 4. Polish User Experience
- [ ] Add loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Implement proper error messages
- [ ] Add tooltips and help text
- [ ] Create onboarding flow for first-time users

## Technical Debt to Address:
- [ ] Replace mock data in `ai_import_cubit.dart` with real AI calls
- [ ] Implement proper JSON decoding in AI service
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout the flow
- [ ] Implement cleanup of temporary PDF files
- [ ] Add logging for debugging and monitoring

## Key Technical Decisions:
1. **AI Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4 for card generation, GPT-3.5-turbo for simpler tasks
2. **PDF Library**: Syncfusion Flutter PDF for robust PDF handling
3. **State Management**: Maintain BLoC pattern, gradually introduce Flutter Hooks
4. **API Management**: Implement token counting and cost estimation upfront
5. **Batch Size**: Process PDFs in 2-3 page chunks for optimal token usage

## Success Metrics:
- Average 15-20 quality cards generated per lecture PDF
- Processing cost < $0.10 per typical 20-page PDF
- User satisfaction with card quality > 85%
- Processing time < 20 seconds for standard lecture PDF
- Reduction in manual card creation time by 80%
