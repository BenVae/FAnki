## Priority 2.5: CardDeckManager Architecture Unification üèóÔ∏è
**Goal:** Eliminate dual-system complexity and create bulletproof card creation flow

### Root Problem Analysis:
The userID empty errors stem from having two deck management systems (CardDeckManager + DeckTreeManager) that are poorly synchronized, creating race conditions and context dependency issues.

### Architectural Solution Options:

#### Option A: Eliminate CardDeckManager (Recommended)
- **Migrate all card operations** to work directly with DeckTreeManager/Firebase
- **Remove CardDeckManager dependency** from CreateCardsCubit
- **Create unified CardService** that handles all card CRUD operations
- **Simplify context chains** by removing dual system dependencies

#### Option B: Reverse Integration  
- **Make DeckTreeManager a wrapper** around CardDeckManager
- **Ensure CardDeckManager is always initialized** before any deck operations
- **Add synchronization layer** between the two systems

### Implementation Strategy (Option A - Recommended):

1. **Create Unified CardService**
   ```dart
   class CardService {
     final FirebaseApi _firebaseApi;
     final AuthenticationRepository _authRepo;
     
     Future<void> addCard(String deckId, String question, String answer);
     Future<List<Card>> getCardsForDeck(String deckId);
   }
   ```

2. **Update CreateCardsCubit**
   ```dart
   class CreateCardsCubit extends Cubit<CreateCardsState> {
     final CardService _cardService;
     final String _deckId; // Direct deck ID, no context dependency
   }
   ```

3. **Streamline Navigation Flow**
   - Pass deck IDs directly instead of relying on CardDeckManager state
   - Remove complex provider chains
   - Make card creation bulletproof with single system

### Benefits:
- **Eliminates userID timing issues** (always available from AuthRepo)
- **Removes dual-system synchronization** complexity
- **Simplifies context dependencies** (no more provider chains)
- **Makes card creation bulletproof** with direct deck ID passing
- **Easier to test and debug** with single system

## Priority 3: GitHub-like Study Timeline
**Goal:** Visual activity tracker showing study patterns

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] Create study_activity collection in Firestore
- [ ] Track daily study sessions with card counts
- [ ] Implement heatmap calendar widget
- [ ] Define color intensity thresholds:
  - Light: 1-10 cards reviewed
  - Medium: 11-30 cards reviewed  
  - Dark: 31+ cards reviewed
- [ ] it should only show the last month (always)
- [ ] I want this to be super minimalistic.

---

## Priority 4: Modern App Navigation
**Goal:** Improve overall navigation and settings

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] Create Settings page with:
  - [ ] Logout functionality
  - [ ] Licenses display
