## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Enable AI Functionality (30 minutes)
**Goal:** Get AI card generation working with real OpenAI API

### Step 1: Environment Setup (5 minutes)
- [ ] Get OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- [ ] Install flutter_dotenv: `flutter pub add flutter_dotenv`
- [ ] Create `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
- [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to keep key secure
- [ ] Update `main.dart` to load environment variables

### Step 2: Fix AI Service (10 minutes)
- [ ] Update `packages/ai_service/lib/src/ai_service.dart`:
  - [ ] Remove mock data from `generateCardsFromText()` (lines 103-107)
  - [ ] Implement proper JSON parsing with `json.decode()`
  - [ ] Use actual OpenAI API key from environment
  - [ ] Parse the actual response structure from GPT
- [ ] Test with a simple PDF to verify cards are generated

### Step 3: Connect AI to UI (10 minutes)
- [ ] Update `lib/src/ai_import/cubit/ai_import_cubit.dart`:
  - [ ] Remove mock cards (lines 67-78)
  - [ ] Call actual AI service: `await _aiService.generateCardsFromPdf(selectedPdf!)`
  - [ ] Use real suggested deck name from AI
  - [ ] Handle API errors properly
- [ ] Test the full flow: PDF upload ‚Üí AI processing ‚Üí Card generation

### Step 4: Error Handling & Polish (5 minutes)
- [ ] Add proper error messages for API failures
- [ ] Show actual processing progress
- [ ] Add cost estimation display
- [ ] Test with various PDF formats
