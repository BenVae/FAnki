## Priority 1: Markdown/Rich Text for Card Back
**Goal:** Enable rich content formatting for answer cards

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] Update AI service prompt to inform GPT about markdown formatting capabilities:
  - [ ] Specify that answers can use markdown syntax
  - [ ] Include LaTeX formula support (e.g., `$...$` for inline, `$$...$$` for block)
  - [ ] Allow code blocks with syntax highlighting (```language)
  - [ ] Support for lists, tables, bold, italic, etc.
- [ ] Add flutter_markdown package for rendering
- [ ] Update Card model to support markdown content
- [ ] Implement markdown editor with live preview
- [ ] Add LaTeX/formula support (katex_flutter or similar)
- [ ] Update card display component to render markdown
- [ ] Add toolbar for common markdown formatting
- [ ] Support for code blocks with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Enable image embedding in cards

## Priority 2: Tree-Structured Decks (Anki-like)
**Goal:** Implement hierarchical deck organization like Anki

### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] Study Anki's deck structure (https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html)
- [x] Modify Deck model to support parent-child relationships
- [x] Update Firestore schema for nested deck structure
- [x] Create expandable tree view UI component
- [x] Implement deck path navigation (breadcrumbs)
- [x] Update deck selection to handle subdeck logic
- [ ] Add deck moving/reorganization functionality
- [ ] Support for deck inheritance settings
- [ ] Note: Focus on basic card type only (as specified)

### Completed:
- Implemented DeckTreeManager for hierarchical deck management
- Created tree view UI with expand/collapse functionality
- Added breadcrumb navigation for deck hierarchy
- Fixed initialization issues with ManageDecksCubitV2
- Resolved infinite loop in deck loading
- Updated deck selection to work with new tree structure

## Priority 3: GitHub-like Study Timeline
**Goal:** Visual activity tracker showing study patterns

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] Create study_activity collection in Firestore
- [ ] Track daily study sessions with card counts
- [ ] Implement heatmap calendar widget
- [ ] Define color intensity thresholds:
  - Light: 1-10 cards reviewed
  - Medium: 11-30 cards reviewed  
  - Dark: 31+ cards reviewed
- [ ] it should only show the last month (always)
- [ ] I want this to be super minimalistic.

## Priority 4: Modern App Navigation
**Goal:** Improve overall navigation and settings

### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] Create Settings page with:
  - [ ] Logout functionality
  - [ ] Licenses display
  - [ ] Version information
  - [ ] User preferences
- [ ] Add persistent deck switcher in top-left corner
- [ ] Refactor learning view to show single card at a time
- [ ] Implement navigation drawer or rail for main sections
- [ ] Add bottom navigation for mobile
- [ ] Create consistent back navigation
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for desktop

- [ ] Create statistics view with pie chart
- [ ] Show distribution of:
  - New cards
  - Learning cards
  - Review cards
  - Suspended cards
- [ ] Add filtering by deck
- [ ] Interactive chart with drill-down

### AI Usage Limitations
- [ ] Add user quota field in Firestore user document
- [ ] Track API calls per user
- [ ] Implement quota checking before AI operations
- [ ] Show remaining quota in UI

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Fix authentication tests
2. Implement Priority 1 (Markdown support)
3. Begin Priority 2 (Tree decks structure)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2)
1. Complete Priority 2 (Tree decks UI)
2. Implement Priority 3 (Study timeline)
3. Start Priority 4 (Navigation update)

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)
