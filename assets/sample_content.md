# Flutter Development Basics

## What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications from a single codebase for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web.

## Key Features of Flutter
1. **Hot Reload**: Allows developers to see changes instantly without restarting the app
2. **Single Codebase**: Write once, deploy everywhere
3. **Widget-based**: Everything in Flutter is a widget
4. **High Performance**: Compiles to native code

## Flutter Architecture
Flutter uses a layered architecture consisting of:
- Framework Layer (Dart)
- Engine Layer (C++)
- Platform-specific embedder

## State Management in Flutter
Common state management solutions include:
- setState(): For simple local state
- Provider: Dependency injection and state management
- BLoC Pattern: Business Logic Component for complex apps
- Riverpod: An improved version of Provider

## Flutter Widgets
### Stateless Widgets
Widgets that don't maintain any state. They are immutable and their properties can't change.

### Stateful Widgets
Widgets that maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget.

## Dart Programming Language
Dart is the programming language used by Flutter. Key features:
- Object-oriented
- Strongly typed
- Supports both AOT and JIT compilation
- Null safety support

## Flutter Development Tools
- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio or VS Code
- Flutter DevTools for debugging
- Flutter Inspector for UI debugging
