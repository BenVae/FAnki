## Roadmap

This place is where ideas for the development are collected.

### Features

**Github like timeline 2**

I would love a discord like calender that shows on which day i studied. It should also have a darker green for days i studied more than x cards. Define a nice leadder of 3 different color shades, when certain thresholds of advanced cards are reached.

**Pie Chart for card states**

I want to get a quick overview of all my cards in the stack, in which state they are.

**Markdown or similar for back card 1**

The solution page should be customizable with richt text or so. Add this information to the card generation promt.

**Anki like structure for decks (tree strctured decs)**

A deck can have subdecks, with subdecks again.
