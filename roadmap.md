## Roadmap

This place is where ideas for the development are collected.

### Features

**Github like timeline**

I would love a discord like calender that shows on which day i studied. It should also have a darker green for days i studied more than x cards. Define a nice leadder of 3 different color shades, when certain thresholds of advanced cards are reached.

**Pie Chart for card states**

I want to get a quick overview of all my cards in the stack, in which state they are.

***Always visible deck switcher**

I dont like the navbar. Where i need more steps for important functionality.

Introduduce a button to show all decks and let me select one. This is also where the generate with ai button should be places

**Anki like structure for decks (tree strctured decs)**

A deck can have subdecks, with subdecks again.
