## Roadmap

This place is where ideas for the development are collected.

### Features

**Github like timeline 3**

I would love a discord like calender that shows on which day i studied. It should also have a darker green for days i studied more than x cards. Define a nice leadder of 3 different color shades, when certain thresholds of advanced cards are reached.

**Pie Chart for card states**

I want to get a quick overview of all my cards in the stack, in which state they are.

**Markdown or similar for back card 1**

The solution page should be customizable with richt text or so. Add this information to the card generation promt. This solution should allow formulars etc.

**Anki like structure for decks (tree strctured decs) 2**

A deck can have subdecks, with subdecks again.
Please take a look at the anki website for background
https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html.

Note: We only need support for one cardType: basic.

**Limitation for AI usasge**

Think about how we can make sure that the Ai capabilities are not exploited and occur high cost. Maybe give users a contingent. But give me the opportunity for testing to have full coningent, save it in my firebase user. Find the best solution.

**Modern app navigation 4**

- Introduce setting page for logout, licenses, version number etc.
- Always show deck switcher on top left.
- when learning cards always just show one card at a time.
